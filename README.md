# Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis

In this project, I explored the funding to Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021 to help my hypothetical team which is trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem make an informed decision.

## Column names and description:
-   **Company/Brand**: Name of the company/start-up. String.

-   **Founded**: Year start-up was founded. String.

-   **Sector**: Sector of operation. String.

-   **What it does**: Description of Company. String.

-   **Founders**: Founders of the Company. String.

-   **Investor**: Investors. String.

-   **Amount(\$)**: Funds raised. Float.

-   **Stage**: Round of funding. String.

 
## Hypothesis

H0: Funding to startups in the Indian ecosystem is centralized around specific locations and sectors.

In line with the above, several questions were asked and some findings made accordingly.


## Conclusion
Accept the null hypothesis as funding is centralized around few locations (Mumbai and Bangalore) and few sectors (Fintech, Retail, Education).


## Recommendation
To the Team, Fintech startups headquartered in Mumbai received significantly higher amounts per deal than the average startup, so prioritize this intersection. Secondly, you may have to seek alternative sources of funding within the first year of operation as you look forward to a funding round.
You may also research further into the other key sectors and locations to be better informed on available options.

Thank you.
